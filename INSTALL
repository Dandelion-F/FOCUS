# Installation instructions

## Requirements

  - Apache Maven >= 3.0
  - Java >= 1.8
  - (optional) Bash for running all evaluations automatically
  
## Instructions

FOCUS can be built using Apache Maven. To build FOCUS, navigate to the `tools/Focus/` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn clean install
```

To run the default evaluation (on the SH<sub>S</sub> dataset using the C1.1 configuration), run the following command:

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.focus.Runner
```

Or, alternatively, use the JAR that has been generated by the `install` command:

```
java -jar target/focus-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

FOCUS should print out the results (success rate, precision, recall) for different cut-off values N={1, 5, 10, 15, 20} directly in the console, e.g.:

```
